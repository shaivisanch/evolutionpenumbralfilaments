Abstract
Context. In the past few decades, advances in space instruments and technology have allowed for the viewing of specific features of sunspots. The structures of thin, radially elongated filaments in the sunspot penumbra have been investigated, however, their evolution over time is unclear.
Aims. The assumptions are that filaments are made up of the head and tail, each part moving directionally opposite to its counterpart. This paper aims to qualitatively document their evolution over time, and quantitatively draw conclusions about changes in their magnetic inclinations, intensities, and directions, over time.
Methods. To further investigate in the Python programming language, comprehensive libraries like open-cv, matplotlib, numpy, and pillow have proven useful. Processing solar images captured by Hinode’s Solar Optical Telescope/Spectropolarimeter, these libraries allow for concatenation of image data into arrays and interactive plots. To quantify this evolution, Scikit-Image contains a variety of algorithms that offer image segmentation, geometric transformation, and image analysis.
Results. It is found that on the filament, the continuum intensity peaks at the head and decreases down the tail. The magnetic inclination decreases from the head to the tail and the inclination in the z direction seems to increase. Over time, these trends seem to be consistent as the filament moves inwards toward the umbra.
